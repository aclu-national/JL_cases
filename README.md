# JL_cases

## Description
This is the Git for the JL_cases project. In this project we are analyzing court cases conducted by [Justice Lab](https://www.aclujusticelab.org/cases/) to create a dashboard to help people understand the breadth of Justice Lab's work in Louisiana. The raw data is collected in [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xfCP7Dg-txaAwgIQs2sjjaQZ0Ur37-2ZCi6TzFj2GJk/edit#gid=585513752) and is update every time Justice Lab finishes a case.

## Navigating the Git
Simply download the the R project and script and run the code. You will not be able to write to the google sheet without proper credentials.
