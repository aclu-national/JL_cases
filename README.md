# JL_cases

## Description
This is the Git for the JL_cases project. In this project we are analyzing court cases conducted by [Justice Lab](https://www.aclujusticelab.org/cases/) to create a dashboard to help people understand the breadth of Justice Lab's work in Louisiana. The raw data is collected in [this google sheet]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xfCP7Dg-txaAwgIQs2sjjaQZ0Ur37-2ZCi6TzFj2GJk/edit#gid=585513752](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRL9lA_QjTdNAp-X6aoDFF0p9WUPd72VzvW48AHAxYHDrEkTsjuaR9sMoF3bWd4SDtHRIDPnWx1Wk9y/pub?gid=585513752&single=true&output=csv)) and is updated on Friday, every two weeks.
